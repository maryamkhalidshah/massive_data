The goal of this project was to explore, clean and analyze Reddit data (of the subreddit unpopularopinion) using PySpark, and to identify one or more questions of interest based on the data.

A Decision Tree Regressor was used to understand whether certain predictors were important determinants of the score (votes) of a comment, while a Random Forest Classifier was used to determine whether, given certain predictors, we can predict whether the comment would be popular/well-liked.
